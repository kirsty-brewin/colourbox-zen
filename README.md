Welcome to ColourBox Zen!

I created this simple app to practise React State.

Each box is clickable and creates a new random background colour.

To begin, I used Vite + React to create my development environment.

I started by making a single box component and created a State to change it to a random colour.

Then I created another component to make 100 boxes in a grid.

I used CSS Flexbox to make it look pretty.

Enjoy! :)
